    <p>
      For my <a href="/research">research</a>, I have written scripts in <em>MATLAB</em> to design controllers, simulate dynamics, implement AI, process signals and interface to external systems. Also, I have built commercial-grade APIs using server-side javascript (<em>Node.js</em>) and data-driven web-applications using the <em>Ruby on Rails</em> framework. From database technologies, I have worked with <em>PostgreSQL</em>, <em>MySQL</em>, and <em>Redis</em>.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some of my past commercial projects:</p>

    <h4>
      Booom.io (Year: 2016, ~242 Commits) <a class="article-link" href="mailto:ali.tivay@gmail.com">[Request Demo]</a>
    </h4>

    <p>
      Booom.io is an ambitious project that provides a multi-tenant platform for e-commerce. Users can sign up and receive their very own online store with just a few easy steps. The platform includes search services, intelligent product recommendation and secure trust-building mechanisms that ensure genuine transactions between buyers and sellers.

      Nnm-server (Year: 2016, ~328 Commits) <a class="article-link" href="mailto:ali.tivay@gmail.com">[Request Demo]</a>
    </h4>

    <p>
      Nnm-server is a real-time Websocket API that is used for fast storage, retrieval, and processing of data between a massive number of simultaneous users. A main application for this technology is realized in massively multiplayer online games (MMOs), where a large number of users need to play together and exchange data on various aspects of a game such as moves, turns, resources and in-game physics.

    <p>
      Diabetic Retinopathy is a serious damage to the retina, that can result in significant loss of vision in diabetic patients. These patients need to be screened regularly to prevent this complication. Often, the resources needed to do so exceeds the available specialists and equipment, especially in remote/under-developed locations. Irtos.org is an online platform aimed at fixing this problem. Patients in remote locations can go to local centers and get inspected. Their data is transferred securely to several graders to be inspected for diabetes-related complications. The system contains mechanism for automatic quality assurance, arbitration and conflict resolution.

    <h4>
      Gardoone (Year: 2015, ~101 Commits) <a class="article-link" href="mailto:ali.tivay@gmail.com">[Request Demo]</a>
    </h4>

    <p>
      Gardoone is an online multi-tenant workflow managements system (WMS). In Gardoone, people can easily sign-up and instantly receive a web-based panel that enables them to create their own workflows. Gardoone's competitive advantage over similar products is that the interface and the calendar system is tailor-made for Persian users. A use-case example can be a manufacturing setting, where a set of design documents need to be automatically routed from designer to director and then to the production engineer. The WMS contains mechanisms for form-building, process-building, assignmet and delegation.
