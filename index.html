      I am a PhD Student in Mechanical Engineering at the <a target="_blank" href="https://umd.edu">University of Maryland - College Park</a>, and a Research Assistant at the <em>Laboratory for Control and Information Systems</em> under the supervision of Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/545/JinOh-Hahn">Jin-Oh Hahn</a>. I obtained my BSc and MSc degrees in Mechanical Engineering from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amirkabir_University_of_Technology">Tehran Polytechnic</a>.

      My current research interests are at the intersection of dynamic systems, control, and healthcare. I do research on inference, prediction, and control problems for models of physiological processes. This research is important because it can help bring about the next generation of medical care devices that can work autonomously with improved safety and efficacy. In the past, I did robotics-focused research on efficiency and performance problems in fluid-power and piezoelectric actuators. I also worked as a back-end software engineer, regularly using NodeJS, Ruby and Python along with relational and in-memory database combinations to deliver a stable online experience.
